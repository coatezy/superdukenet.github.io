Bikenutter and his lot arrived late after one of his mates MV's broke its rear wheel bearing, poor bastard had to rent a car instead! Still when they arrived a few went straight up to the ring for a couple laps and they were all stopped by the Polizeit on the way for noisy cans! 100 euro fines for all, still smiling tho and even got a picture with the coppers! Some of their bikes were awesome especially a beautiful 1098r with traction control and everything. Sunk too much beer that night and getting up in the morning was not easy, still the Ring awaits!<br><br>On the Saturday the ring was closed until 2pm so we went for a ride down the Rhine to Cochem, this was a lovely place and it was 28 degrees there! Nice gentle ride down(almost too gentle) with all the others, 15 bikes I think. One of our guys didn't go cos he was still drunk so we split off from the pack and headed back to pick him up and get to the ring for 2ish.<br><br>Got to the ring about 2pm and bought our Ring card ready. Proper jitters at this point, first track experience since last August. Did one lap about 2.30 and back in the carpark at 2.40 so happy with that. That lap was good but it doesn't half give you a shock when Cars come steaming up behind you mid corner, the realisation that you aren't the quickest compared with the roads is quite something. When you can't keep up with Clio sport you know you don't have a chance up against the numerous Porsche GT's Ferrari 430's 458's Nissan GTR's BMW M3's and M5. Still I did pass a Maserati Quattroporte and 911 so that was good!<br><br>We then went for lunch in the devils diner, Currywurst, chips and a coke. Very nice but left with curry breath in your helmet? Not so nice. <br><br>After lunch we went out for another lap and it was more of the same really, fast cars, German GSXR750's going past like your standing still but hey ho. This was a bit quicker but I was pissed that I wasn't faster really. The Carousel part is the most famous but also the bumpiest bit of track ever, forget Castle Combe! Tried high and low lines and didn't like either. So that was a long day believe it or not so we went back to the guesthouse for another bbq, beer and an early night.<br><br>Sunday morning got up early ready to be at the track for opening at 8am, got there at 9am and the track was closed to bikes Some car had dropped Oil so I can understand really. We were told it would be open in half an hour but an hour later another car dropped its coolant and that was that. We decided to get up to Brunchenn and watch the cars going round, wait for bikes to get going and then go back for some laps. Saw a couple bikes come through and then it all went quiet. A BMW had literally dropped its oil on the racing line for half the lap, so the track was closed to everyone I would hate to see his bill! We decided to do some sunbathing and eating and eventually an hour later the track opened again. We got down there quick and had another lap (number 3) This was a bad one, it was all good until the yellows came out and there was an R1 in the barrier, marshalls everywhere and a long line of yet more oil. I just froze and couldn't enjoy it or relax. Literally as we finished the track was closed again and ambulances and fire engines were everywhere. We thought that would be it for the afternoon so decided to come back later for our last lap if it had opened again. I would have been gutted if this was my last lap and had to waste one left on my Ring Card.<br><br>At this point we decided to go and ride some local roads, these are smooth, traffic free and have amazing bends. TBH you could visit just for the roads alone. We treated these like a racetrack too! <br><br>We then went back to the Ring for our final laps, fortunately it was quiet and open! So not wanting to let nerves get the best of me I went out on my own before my mates were ready, this took the pressure to perform off. This lap was awesome, there was no traffic, no yellow flags and only a handful of Porsches on the track. Faster than ever, smooth relaxed and I finally got my knee down. Pulled in to the paddock and bought 2 more laps and went straight out again, these were even better. I'm so glad that I left there with 5 out of 6 laps that I was happy with. I did a 10.17 lap which I am happy with, I topped out the SD at 145mph for the first time racing a GT3RS down Dottinger Hohe (and lost) but just awesome. <br><br>It was sad to ride away from there, it truly is the greatest track in the world and to know I might never get back is sad, here's hoping car sales get better again!<br><br>We went out for a great meal in a Steakhouse that was recommended where you cook it yourself on a hot stone, this place was a racers mecca full of memorabilia adorning the walls. Was supposed to get an early night but got pissed again?!<br><br>So Monday morning was ride home day. We decided that we would go the scenic route and thought 5 hours would be enough to get to Calais, rode some amazing roads again through Germany and Belgium before getting on the motorway at Brussels and blasting back. Got lost in Brussels briefly and stuck on boring dead straight roads for ages. We ended up going faster and faster to try and get the ferry but missed it by 10 minutes because of French customs, twats. <br><br>I had done all the navigating in Europe and left it to Ktmmikes dad to get us home from Dover, we immediately ended up the wrong way out of Dover and added another 1/2 hr on the journey but hey ho.<br><br>Still a great trip recommended to all, If you get the chance just go!<br><br>Its obviously very dangerous there but if you keep your eyes peeled and your ears open you'll be ok.<br><br>Had a great time with Mike, Alan and Mark too. We ate a lot, drank a lot and raced around a lot. Truly an awesome weekend, can't wait to go back! <br><br>When I get pictures and video sorted I'll try to get it posted.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/jambox.svg" alt=jambox> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">jambox</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-05-10 21:43:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Quality write up mate.
