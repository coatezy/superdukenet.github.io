He suffered a compound fracture of this leg and effed up his shoulder. Those injuries plagued him for a long time, and may still plague him. He slammed into one of his best friend's body and his friend died before his eyes. That image is probably burned into his mind. <br><br>So Rossi's had a whole lot of reality checks in the last couple of years. That's a whole lot of shit to clear out of your head and set your mind to the task at hand, especially as you get longer in the tooth. If you watch him ride, he's not taking the chances that he used to. Taking those chances is what made him a superstar, but I think those days are over. I believe the leg fracture was and is a constant reminder of his mortality. Plus, he probably has enough eff you money to never have to work again. So, why should he take crazy chances? He'll finish his contract with Ducati, say the bike was unrideable and retire. He may not go out of the top of the pile, but he'll always have 9 world championships under his belt to show what a stellar rider he was.<br><br>As for the rest of them, I'm glad Stoner is around. I'd stop watching MotoGP if it was the Jorge Lorenzo show. He bores the hell out of me as does Dovi. I hope Spies clears the cob webs out and starts performing, but only time will tell. If he doesn't get his shit together soon, I'd be watching for Bradl to take his place. I was pumped to see Nicky dicing it up, but he couldn't keep up the pace. <br><br>Marquez rides the fooking wheels off his bike and is going to be really tough to catch this year. (I think they might have purposefully screwed him at Jerez to keep the points close because he was checking out when they red flagged the race.) He truly seems to be toying with the rest of the field. Say what you will about Iannone, but Crazy Joe is exciting to watch on most days. I think his unpredictability causes his opponents to have fits and makes for great racing.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DribbleDuke.svg" alt=DribbleDuke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">DribbleDuke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-02 06:22:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>No one has mentioned Romano Fenati.<br>Its very early days yet but he looks like the real thing to me.<br>Apparently he'd never raced in anything other than dry conditions before!<br><br>As others have said: I loved Scot Reading's riding but he is hampered by being so much heavier than his rivals.

I'd very much like to see him make the move up to MotoGP next year.<br><br>I was delighted and impressed with Cal's ride. He looked to me as though he was riding that Yamaha like he rode the R6, I was convinced he was going to loose the front so many times. Got to say i agree: his job will get harder as the works Yams and Hondas improve and the Tech3 bikes don't but I think the rate at which he's improving its not impossible for him to score podiums.<br><br>For me it was a fantastic weekends racing.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Reb.svg" alt=Reb> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Reb</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-02 08:58:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I havnt watched the Moto2 yet but i may have to sit down and watch it today by the sound of it </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DribbleDuke.svg" alt=DribbleDuke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">DribbleDuke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-05-02 20:45:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I think little Pedbot might be on his last go round on the factory bike.
