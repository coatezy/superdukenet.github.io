The brand new Aprillia Tuono V4R was the center of attention. The Ducati Streetfighter, the Triumph Speed Triple, the MV Brutale, and of course the KTM Super Duke R. <br><br><a class=postlink href="http://www.motorcyclenews.com/MCN/News/newsresults/videos/2011/June/jun0211-video-aprilia-tuono-v4r-takes-on-rivals/">http://www.motorcyclenews.com/MCN/News/ ... on-rivals/</a><br><br>You can watch the video/read the article or you can just jump to what I have to say. The Aprillia won first place (big surprise) but the KTM came in dead last basically because its "starting to show its age". As soon as I read that I thought, well wait until the SD gets the RC8 engine in there! But wait...that probably won't happen until 2013. The competition is nudging that figure right now in 2010/2011. Then I recalled a comparison between the RC8 and other super-sport bikes (GSX-R1000, CBR1000, ZX-10R, etc). Once again, the KTM came in last. Is the RC8 engine in the new SD going to be enough? The 2011 Tuono comes stock with 165 bhp, it'll no doubt have at least 170 by the time the new SD is released. I love my SD to death but are these "hyper V2's" enough to stay competitive, or does KTM need to rethink their street bike motorcycles? Thoughts?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/darko.svg" alt=darko> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">darko</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-24 01:12:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>KTM isn't a huge company and they blew their collective load on development of the RC8.<br><br>You can't expect mags to still vote a 4 year old model (07 SDR, right?) at the top of the charts when there's better competition out there now.

There is no shortage of riders that can though. On half that power. How many of their owners will ever twist the grip to where the bike will be putting all that power to the ground?<br><br>Seriously, its about the rider. We all know these mags are in business to sell advertising. The only way they do that, is by touting the "latest and greatest" whatever it is. Bikes and related sell, manufacturers take out more advertising, and the cycle continues. <br><br>As long as 19 yo boys keep getting hard-ons from this stuff and keep buying the advertised products - it will never end.<br><br>I can't imagine ever wanting more than 100 - 130Hp on a naked/hooligan bike - even if it were my only bike. What's it good for - bragging rights on bike night? Sure as hell isn't going to get you laid.<br><br>I'll take light, slim, flickable, and V-twin corner exits over electric-triples, V-4s, or ugly-ass overwrought v-twin poseur rides. Big deal - so those guys spent more money than I did. This week. Maybe. Still gonna leave their owners for dead in the canyons/twisties with little effort. On just about any decent road course, those bikes aren't killing it unless they are in the right hands. And the only people around capable, are usually getting paid to do so.<br><br>I don't know about the rest of you - but you ever do a valve check/adjust on a V4 bike? On this side of the pond, Aprilia parts distribution is a long running joke - why their bikes have the worst return (%) at resale than just about any other brand. Ever do your own 4V desmo tunes, or belt changes? Yeah, that's a joy too. I dunno what Triumph was thinking with the new Speed, but its uglier in person than in pictures. First guy with a bolt-on round headlight kit is going to make a little coin. Was at the stealer today, and while better, still bloated and soft in all the wrong places. Rather have the StripleR.<br><br>IMO - nothing to get excited about. I'd trade KTM handing us a map and whatever else is needed to get the (low end) fueling sorted on the SD/SDR, for all that negative hyperbole - any day.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/darko.svg" alt=darko> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">darko</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-24 02:17:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I can ALWAYS take advantage of more power, YESSS PLEAASSEE!!! <br><br>I wouldn't trade my SDR for any current bike. I like the Duc Streetfighter, I like the Speed Triple, even the Aprilia Tuono looks like a pretty sweet ride... but the SDR is just on a level of its own. Maybe its the exclusivity here in Canada with only a handful of units making it across the border, but I just can't see myself selling this bike unless KTM makes an even sweeter version of it in the future.<br><br>With that being said, magazines have a job to do and they simply won't give a 4 year old model better grades than a new bike. Not just that, but I can see why the SDR wouldn't perhaps rank as high as a Streetfighter or a Speed Triple on a first test... it's not quite as polished around the edges and the fueling is a big turn-off to first time riders. I'm happy as a pig in shit with my SDR, but I'm also very used to it.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/RobTaylor.svg" alt=RobTaylor> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">RobTaylor</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-24 02:48:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>The bike is long overdue for an update.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/AGRO.svg" alt="AGRO!"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">AGRO!</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-24 02:51:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content><span style="color: #008000">Thats why I dont ride sports bikes anymore as you just cant use all that power.

KTM SD "The definitive hooligan machine". MV Brutale "Too much power". Aprilia Tuono "I was expecting a savage stiff beast, it's not like that at all, it's so much more forgiving" as if its safe for your wife to drive. It sounds to me that the Brutale is the real favorite for raw power and blingy features. Out of the italian bikes I get the impression that Brutale is the stallion, Aprilia is the mare.

Now, it's a smaller motor, but other than that it's the current top handler from Ducati. Even after becoming very used to it I would take the SD anyday, even completely ignoring comfort. The slow turn in of the Duc chassis, the shorter suspension travel, for the street I'd way rather be canyon carving on the SD. On the track, over 100mph, different deal. In thinking about the Streetfighter, despite wider bars it's a lazier geometry and heavier than 848. So even with the power I'd never consider it. The Aprilia? I don't want to be spinning up a 4 on the street, and I don't want to be depending on Aprilia's distribution and parts. The Brutale? Only as a spare bike. Have we all heard the stories about months and months of waiting for parts? For me that leaves the new Speed Trip. The old one had a pathetic frame for hard street riding in twisties, anyone who has tried one and is a good rider with track experience notices that immediately, though the magazines soft pedaled that...until now, when the finally admit how flawed the old frame was now that the Trip has a new one. So, I'll try that bike, for fun. <br><br>If the SD is losing its edge then where is the bike that is so much better, unless we define more power as better? The Street Triple is the only one I'd consider, though I have not ridden it yet. For me the SD with Akras and a map is still a great, very exciting bike. Remember, magazines exist not as "not for profit" entities! First priority is profit. And raving about a design last updated in 07, which has been raved by many magazines, is a loser. It's old news, no matter how good it is. Testers raving new, different bikes is exciting to readers and that's job 1. That puts KTM and companies like them in a tough spot. Change just for the sake of change is very important in consumer goods. I learn that hard lesson all the time in my business. New sells. Old sits around.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/MacBoarder.svg" alt=Mac_Boarder> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Mac_Boarder</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-24 14:16:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>It's a crap article.

Good PR (i.e. journailsm) is all part of the marketing plan, and they need to feed the market to keep existing. Imagine a review that said - "what you have in your garage is already enough". That'll be that day. <br><br>Besides, the Superduke is still a class-defining modern streetbike with attitide, a stonking engine and handling, and the chassis parts ooze quality. It's a few years old now, but each model change has brought subtle upgrades, and the newer bikes are pretty much up to the quality levels of all the competition in class. The Latest changes to the SDR are only four years old.<br><br>Who cares if the RSV4 Tuono is this year's fashionable bike. It's ugly and has no character. It looks to me like a racebike without a fairing to me. If I wanted one of those I might buy one. But I don't.<br><br>I'll keep an eye out for what KTM do next, and if they get it right, I'll upgrade - but I hope they evolve the Superduke along the same lines that made it the cult success that it is today, and I'd be more excited about smoother-fuelling, weight-loss and a slipper clutch as standard, than pointless increases in bhp for useless dyno shoot-outs. The bike is already better than me.<br><br>Besides, it's more fun to be the underdog and then out-ride people on those "better" bikes. <br>...I lapped a guy on a Aprilia Mille at Brands Hatch on an air-cooled 90bhp Ducati with twin shocks last weekend. His scrunched-up copy of Bike mag's rave Aprilia reviews won't help him lap any faster.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/tripoddave.svg" alt=tripoddave> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">tripoddave</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-28 15:58:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Interesting to see MCN coming down in favor of the V4R Tuono.
