Love the style of the bike and the fun factor I keep reading about BUT I am a newer rider (not a squid!).<br><br>I have a very healthy respect for the bike and I am not one who is into stunts, wheelies, knee dragging or racing on the street/blind turns. <br><br>I want the bike because its a naked bike that can handle/stop well, comfortable, I can grow into and its rare and unique (also looking at FZ-09, but suspension/brakes need help). I am a bigger guy at 6', 240lbs if that matters. <br><br>I have no dissolution's that it is an aggressive bike and honestly more than I can use with my current skill/knowledge level. My questions is, if ridden responsible would is it a good bike to grow into?<br><br>I am currently riding my 03' Kawi KLX400 dual-sport with street orientated tyres (full exhaust, 3x3 airbox hole, jetted). I like it for what it is however my plan is to put dot knobies on it and keep it for adventure/trail, using the duke for street/day tips/getaway (possible track days in a year or more when I have more experience/take more class's/training).<br><br>Sorry for the long post, give it to me straight.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Andrew</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Matteson.svg" alt=Matteson> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Matteson</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-07-29 17:13:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I think it would be a great bike for you if you're moving from a dual sport to a "street bike". The SD is light for a big bore V-twin and it is nimble so getting used to the characteristics of the SD is easier than most other sport bikes especially coming from a dual sport bike. Just keep the respect you have now and you'll love the Super Duke. BTW you know that the original Duke I 620/400 was based on the KTM 620 GS/RXC Dual Sport with 17" wheels and a small fairing and out of it grew the 990 Super Duke (and the '95 modified 620 to a 660 Super Duke </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Woody80.svg" alt=Woody80> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Woody80</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-07-29 17:25:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ktmguy.svg" alt=ktmguy> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">ktmguy</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-07-29 18:52:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Hi mate.<br><br>This is my opinion.<br><br>No bike is too much for anyone really, it depends how you ride it or respect what it is. OK there are some really bonkers bikes with lots of HP or tuned specials that have intense powerbands but modern bikes are all able to be ridden sensibly if you want to. I think the SD is a great bike for you to move up from your supermoto type bike. It may have more cylinders and more power but it's got a sort of similar DNA in it's blood and you won't find it hard to adapt. <br><br>Reading this forum for years I think the biggest challenge people find is the riders who are used to Inline fours because their experience of power delivery is so smooth and turbine like and they are not used to the rather brutal and unforgiving nature of a big V twin. They can't easily adapt to the low down torque and engine braking and complain of jerky and "on/off" throttle response but really it's that they have not adapted to the engine configuration and need to understand that a clutch is there for a reason. Riding around on old Ducati twins you just get used to slipping the clutch all the time below 30mph to keep things smooth!<br><br>The 990 Superduke is a lovely compromise between old school mechanicals and modern technology, no electronic aids, medium horse power for a 1000cc. But it is packaged in a beautiful handling frame matched to top spec. suspension and totally fantastic brakes. This combination delivers a great experience and a great motorbike - the kind of bikers that own them are mostly a lot of people who have tried and owned a lot of different bikes and end up realising that this is a great all round bike that delivers thrills and performance that matches or beats many other bikes they've previously owned. They have a lot of loyalty and that must count for something.<br><br>You can ride this bike in anger and it still is competitive on the road against almost anything. It's certainly down to the rider ability not the power deficiency that makes the difference. On track it gets a bit beaten up on the long straights by bikes with 60 horsepower more but you usually pass them on the next corner because it goes round them so well. It's riding position mean that you can do long haul trips without aching wrists and a bad back. Its a great town commuter because it's tall and lets you see where you are in traffic and it's agile and easy to turn and twist to the front of any traffic light que - leaving those sports bikes with limited lock stuck far behind. If you want to learn how to wheelie - this is the bike, just nail it at 5000rpm in first and feel the front float. And stoppies are a must with those brakes and a good set of tyres.<br><br>But you can also pootle around slowly and enjoy the scenery or pop down to the shops. It won't mind, but it might just start to encourage you to ride a bit harder or a bit faster - it definitely has the hooligan inside and will make you want to see what it can do.<br><br>Buy one. You won't regret it.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Matteson.svg" alt=Matteson> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Matteson</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-07-29 19:29:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Agree with bic because I have owned inlines and v twins of other makes and this bike is the happy medium that is still on the outside.
