I was tempted by the Multistrada at last years bike show. 1198 engine, traction control, go anywhere chassis - what's not to like?<br><br>Then a mate bought one, the S Model 14000 quid sterling plus a couple of grand of extras. He had nothing but problems with it and the bike was in dealers more than he had it. He was pretty coy about all the faults at the time after bigging the bike up so much when he got it but from what I remember; it was always cutting out, he dropped it during a low speed manouver when it cut out, not a known Ducati fault. The entire left hand switchgear packed up and hand to be replaced. He had about 3 repairs / replacement to the rear brake and none improved it. He hit a pheasant, hardly the bikes fault, and needed a new mirror - none in the country and no date when there will be 9in the end he got a dealer to take one off a showroom bike. There is no doubt more but he got rid, what is the point of having a tourer that never gets further than 10 miles from the dealers? In one of his numerous conversations with Ducati they admitted the bike had been brought to market too soon and really needed 6 months more testing.<br><br>None of these are unknown faults, other owners are getting some or none of them. It just seems he was unlucky to get a bike with all of them. I dont know if the basic model has similar faults or it the more electrical s that has all the problems.<br><br>Here is the worst bit, after 4 months of ownership he tried to trade it for anything else. First dealer offered him 6000 sterling!!! eventually he got 11000 but had to leave a lot of his bling on. Still a 5000 loss for 4 months of hassle. Worse thing was the new owner took the bike to London and got stranded there when the immobiliser developed a fault on his first ride. <br><br>Big shame as I though it would be a great bike.<br><br>Even if you find a good one and p/ex the SD you will need to put in another 6000 quid minimum. I am now looking at a two year old 1050 Triumph Tiger ABS for less than 6 grand so I can do a bit of touring next year and still keep the SDR.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/BASH69.svg" alt=BASH69> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">BASH69</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-08-01 07:45:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/loony888.svg" alt=loony888> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">loony888</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-08-01 09:52:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>i love ducati's, i've owned several, maybe more, and currently own two, but i would give a multi a BIG swerve, far too much electrical gizmo crap, if you must have one, wait till they have been out a couple more years, might have the bugs ironed out by then. frankly, if you want a dual purpose bike get a proper one, a GS.<br><br>paul</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Aussieduke.svg" alt=Aussieduke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Aussieduke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-08-01 10:19:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Well say I'm getting old ( and sensible?) but I've alway been a victim of the grass is always greener when it comes to bike ownership!<br>I think many people buy, thinking they will be faster on a newer bigger HP bike. But the bike is largely irrelevant, and you may not be quicker, happier or more impressed with a new bike unless it is vastly different, and to be used for a different purpose than the previous.<br><br>While I had an Aprila RSVR prior to the SD, the duke is so much more fun and comfortable which I like and am happy with it.<br>If I were to trade it on a Tuono, or jap naked, I would be no faster and probably no happier! I love the SD, it ticks all the boxes as an underdog. Not being over powered means you can wring it's neck, ride it to it's limits and get that pump from getting the best from it. Quite frankly, if you need more it should be on the track!<br><br>I have a track bike for that purpose.<br><br>On the road the SD is the ultimate for me, a hooligan bike with attitude, capable of embaressing any other road bike in the right hands.<br><br> So weigh up carefully before changing.

I recently moved from the SD to an RC8. Is it faster? Yes in a straight line, but my conspicuous lack of cornering skill, still means I go round corners just the same as I did before. So why change? Well partly because of the afore mentioned urge and partly because I do a lot of miles and my SD was racking them up after 4 years and partly (mainly)I got a really good price on the RC8.<br>I'm betting you will have none of the above factors playing for you except the urge to change. Let me guess, not many miles on the SD, price of the Multi north of £10k? You haven't got a lot of reasons to change really have you?<br>But, ultimately s'up to you. If you really want it and you just know it would be great for everyone if you had one and you'll never want another motorbike again and it could be your birthday and xmas present combined and you could really show everyone etc.....

Hot Rodded with hi-comp pistions, Power Comander, CF cans, bunch of CF, ect. Pull the trigger on this boomer and things happen and the corner gets in you face real quick, then it's like, crap how am I going to get all this weight around the corner? Well, compaired to the SD anyway. So the ST4S is a Sport Tourer and it came with Hard Bags. I don't trust the Ducati for touring so off came the bags. A 1999 Triumph Tiger is my tour rig, Took it on a 3K trouble free trip to Yellowstone last year, put maybe 4K on this season, no problems. The SD is used alot cause it's light, works all the time and gets around the corners great. What I have noticed is the DUCATI is the Chick magnet. I find guys looking at my SD when its parked. And the Tiger is a heavy beast to pick up when you find a wet dirt road, but it is oh so cush on a long ride. Get the Duck if you never had one, and sell it when needed. My Duck really is quite the ride and pumps me up, when it runs.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/2bigalow.svg" alt=2bigalow> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">2bigalow</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-08-02 22:28:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>My mates got one the only good thing about it is he can now do a wheely with out flipping it with the wheely control system on it </div></p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/about" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/terms" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
