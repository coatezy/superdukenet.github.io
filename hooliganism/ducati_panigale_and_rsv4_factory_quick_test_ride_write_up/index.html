Handling is exquisite... but harsh. You look at a corner and it goes round... but then you open it up and it just fires itself away.... simply mind blowing.<br><br>All of that said.. i really don't like it.. it's not a bike to ride to the shops, to work or just out for a nice ride... .it's a weapon, simple as that.<br><br>The RSV4.<br>This is more spacious than the Panigale, feeling softer on the bouncy bits. The whole bike is 'nice'... Power is sweet, smooth, silky smooth. Brakes are great, although you don't really use them as you use the slipper clutch more to settle it into corners than comfort braking. It's an easy bike to ride and rewarding with it. But that said, it does have a certain amount of 'soul' to it i admit. You ride it like an IL4, but with abit more grunt.. If i were contemplating lobbing Â£10,000 at a sportsbike this would be high up the list.
