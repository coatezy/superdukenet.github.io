We all aspired to the fully-faired racing bikes that our heroes rode in the GPs but very few of us could afford to buy the full-fairing kits available. <br><br>Then by the 1990's every super-sports bike that came out of Japan and Italy were all rear-set, clip-ons and full-fairing bikes that made you have to squat, bend your knees and tuck in down the straights (as well as hang off in the corners!) I had a decade of fun on these type of bikes.<br><br>By the noughties I was approaching fifty years old and maybe a bit tired of riding flat-out on public roads and trying to recreate my youth all the time. I had realised that some bikes were at least a good as super-sports bikes without all the race-rep stuff and compromised riding that they delivered. I wanted a bike that was as fast and well-handling as the previous Ducatis I'd owned, as practical as the VFR Honda for long distances I'd owned and as mad and indestructible as the KTM Supermotos I'd owned.<br><br>Introducing the Superduke! <br><br>This is a bike that can be fun and yet all under 100 MPH. Supersport bikes would cost me my license eventually but the naked superbike means that the high speeds are kept lower because of the wind resistance and I rarely go for long over 120mph because it is too hard to hang on. (and my neck and shoulders can take no more, ha ha.)<br><br>Best all rounder I've ever imagined was possible. Ten years on I'm still am a fan and am not persuaded to change bikes.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Woody80.svg" alt=Woody80> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Woody80</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2016-10-27 22:59:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Yep, good question...<br><br>Pretty much the same view as Bic..

Firstly I tried an SDR at Almeria and had an absolute hoot, felt I could get away with anything. So much less intimidating when it slid and just immediately felt comfortable going quick. The second reason was to slow me down on the roads, even despite my youth I got achy wrists at low speeds riding supersports and they just egg you on, I just pinned it everywhere and often saw double the national limit seconds after leaving a residential area. Could only go one of two ways. <br><br>Ironically since buying the SDR I've only ridden on the roads for about 100 miles in 3 years since the track bug has bitten. Have looked at other naked bikes though as a road bike to encourage a slower pace and with two up options. The SuperDuke didn't really slow my road riding down, I just felt the wind more!!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/No47.svg" alt="No. 47"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">No. 47</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2016-10-28 16:03:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>get this, i went from Ducatis, a 748s to a KTM 640 supermoto, i never wanted a sportbike after that, right to the 990SD</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Gimlet.svg" alt=Gimlet> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Gimlet</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2016-10-28 20:59:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>went to naked bikes due to mc accident<br>2 plates n 11 screws in my right knee ended my sport bikes<br>huskys,ducati,now ktm<br>love the 1290 R </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/SarasotaSteve.svg" alt=Sarasota_Steve> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Sarasota_Steve</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2016-10-28 21:24:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I grew up in the 70's had dirt bikes, even snuck my dads cb 350 out on the dirt once, I was 17 wrecked it, pushed it home, rolled up some clothes into a sleeping bag, and hitched out to california where I stayed a few months, Old man had a temper back then and I knew he would need a cool down before he saw me again.

The riding position is more aggressive and sporty than the SDR but its not as extreme as a true sports bike. Its a perfect compromise. I've had the suspension upgraded with Ohlins and K-tech and it handles like a track weapon but its much more comfortable. The riding position makes moving around on the seat and hanging off the easiest thing in the world and I love the feeling of slenderrness and lack of mass which comes from having no bodywork. Compared to the SDR you sitting on it rather than in it. I can ride it like a sports bike but at road bike speeds. Its been blue-printed and tuned for extra mid-range and bottom end punch. Its not as flat-out fast as a 200 bhp sports bike but its not far off and you don't need to be revving the nuts off it to find prodigious shove. You don't need to be doing 150 mph for it to make sense. It makes a superlative B road scratcher which you can ride all day without needing physiotherapy afterwards. <br>The SDR is a more comfortable, less sports-focused variation on the theme. They're both roadsters but where the Streetfighter shows its sports bike genes, the SDR has a more supermoto/muscle bike feel. Its an all-rounder. They go together very well without feeling they're duplicating one another.<br><br>And then I've got an SMT for everything else..</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Scotty.svg" alt=Scotty> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Scotty</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2016-12-12 12:59:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/shadowman.svg" alt=shadowman> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">shadowman</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2016-12-12 15:29:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="about.html" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="terms.html" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
