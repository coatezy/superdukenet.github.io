It's well known that the pistons can seize in the bores, especially in winter when the salt makes them more prone to corrosion. KTM's official response has always been to say that you should thoroughly wash your brakes after EVERY ride with clean water (Which is a poor and impractical suggestion).<br><br>Be interesting to see if other people now start to claim compensation from KTM.<br><br>Mind you, I have non standard Brembo Monoblock M5 calipers fitted to my bike and this January they started seizing too. When I rode off one morning I could feel the drag and when I pulled over the right hand front disc was really hot. I gave the caliper a good bang with a bit of wood and carried on riding (with a lot of angst I must admit) but then it seemed to free up and was back to normal. Later when I was back home I took the calipers off any gave them a good clean and pushed all the pistons back to make sure they were free moving. So maybe this is just an issue with Brembo brakes - or maybe all brakes when ridden through British winters? They all need maintaining to work safely and efficiently.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/No47.svg" alt="No. 47"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">No. 47</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2017-05-07 12:21:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Part of the problem is as the calipers get more "racey" they require more cleaning. There is a reason you see race teams whipping the calipers off the bikes after every practice and taking them off for a clean. I'm going to be very careful with the M50 calipers on my 1290. A mate has just spent £90k having a WSB spec R1 built. He's got some ridiculous £20k Brembos on it and was told keep them clean! Didn't listen and brake drag had him off at Aragon.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DukeNukem999.svg" alt=DukeNukem999> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">DukeNukem999</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2017-05-07 13:59:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Reading the various reports of the case and reading between the lines(never a good idea I'll admit) I wonder if the tighter tolerances and perhaps a few water traps on these calipers are the "design flaw" mentioned. That combined with the amount of salt we use on the UK roads created a perfect storm for a few riders. <br><br>I was in a bike shop in the Highlands a few years ago when two senior managers from Honda came in and started talking to us about road salt and bike corrosion. Apparently Hondas sold in Scotland have the higher number warranty claims for corrosion than anywhere else in the world. <br><br>I'm lucky to be able to wash and dry(air blaster) my SD after every ride and pick and choose when I ride but if I needed it for everyday transport things might be different</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/jmann.svg" alt=jmann> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">jmann</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2017-05-07 16:31:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>One for russ_fae_fyvie, methinks - <a class=postlink-local href="http://www.superduke.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=10751&amp;hilit=Front+brakes+locked">viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=10751&amp;hilit=Front+brakes+locked</a> etc, etc.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/orangeracer.svg" alt=orangeracer> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">orangeracer</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2017-05-07 18:28:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/orangeracer.svg" alt=orangeracer> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">orangeracer</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2017-05-07 19:44:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bicbicknell.svg" alt=bic_bicknell> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bic_bicknell</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2017-05-07 22:05:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Cheers for the post, checking mine this weekend.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DribbleDuke.svg" alt=DribbleDuke> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">DribbleDuke</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2017-05-08 04:09:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Comrades: I think there are many lessons to be learned from this experience.<br><br>Obviously I have great sympathy for the comrade concerned. It is possible he deserves the compensation but I don't want to comment on that.<br><br>What I want to comment on is the vendor's responsibility to design things that are not flawed. If modern brakes are prone to failure when ridden within the markets in which they are sold (eg UK with it's salt or snow) then there is a responsibility to come up with a better design for those regions. I note that here in Oz we are fortunate and generally suffer less from such extreme riding conditions.<br><br>I also note that with litigation there are no real winners. Sometimes we hear about awards of millions of dollars but what value is that if one is a paraplegic or worse? In the case in question, the amount is much less, but we all end up paying for that amount as increased insurance premiums. I have personally paid huge amounts for insurance on my KTM's simply because of the statistics that show they are at "high risk". This risk involves both the rider - "ride it like you stole it" and the company - "there is no defect". Try telling that to all who have had wobbly swing-arms!<br><br>I guess the bottom line is that one has to take some responsibility for one's health with a modicum of prophylactic maintenance. Speaking of which saddens me to note that the Nakeds section is all but dead Pete.
