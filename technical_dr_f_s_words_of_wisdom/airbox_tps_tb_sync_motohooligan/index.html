Its hard to nail down a fix when you change 5-6 things at once and it solves the problem.<br><br>I have a USA model 2007 Ktm Super Duke 990 +-9,000 miles. I bought the bike with 5,200 miles with Round Arka Cans (baffles out) from the previous owner who installed the Arka Map. It always seem to run rich for me, and smelled a little bit. He was anal about the bike, had all paper work and kept it spotless. He's a great guy, we ride sometimes. The bike had all the service from a qualified shop tsbs. I felt like I was getting a very cared for machine and I did.<br><br>For me, not owning a street bike before it was a new thing. I didn't know what to expect per say. I move here to Cali and I was all set to get a 950 Adventure but things changed. A good buddy has a 990R bike, I rode it and I was sold. I am 6'3" weigh 195 with full gear on, I love the open upright riding position. Its so very comfortable for me and my height. I love the sound of the Ducati 748 but alas, not the bike for me. The Duke is perfect for hollywood bars or riding in the Santa Monica Mountains. I typically enjoy 30-75 mph riding in canyons and besides errands around town its where I ride. I had West Coast GP Cycles take a look at my suspension and adjust sage, preload etc. It was nice, $50 and I can ride it and come back and they will tweak it for me. Cheap and made a difference for sure. The bike was always and ON/OFF switch for throttle response. I had most of the cable slack taken out of the throttle and I really tried hard to keep my wrist locked. It was constant effort to ride smooth on my bike. It was a pain in the ass to occasionally take a girl on the back. I had to constantly keep apologizing that I knew how to ride, It was embarrassing. I was coming up on the 9,000 service and I was leaving the country for almost 1 month. I was about to finish my extended warranty and I had a coolant leak so I dropped it off at Z-Racing in Orange. I drop shipped the Motobox kit with flys, SAS plates and the Tank slider hinges to them. They took care of it all. I typically enjoy working on my bike but I had no time and I have yet to work on this machine, sadly. I will eventually work on it myself but it was nice to pick up a machine that is 'all set'. Paying for it all will hurt a bit.<br><br>I drive it 5.1 miles to MotoGPWerks to get it Dynoed. I get it in 3 days. <br><br>Let me say that the bike is night and day different. It is amazingly smooth but there is less engine braking I noticed, I like engine braking. At first I felt like there was less power because of the smoothness from a stop light. Let me say that whacking the throttle at any rpm level is amazing, all the power is still there. It will take a little bit to get used to and I can't wait. I think that the lack of engine braking is due to the the new flys. Its hard to say why it has all change because I (the shop) changed so many things at once. I really love the bike and I urge you to get a motobox, sas kit and adjust your TPS and sync your throttle bodies. If you have time and a garage start with the throttle body syncing, the tech said mine were quite a bit off. Then change something else. I had read so many people trying to solve this, G2 cams etc. I am so very excited to get the custom map and ride my 'new' bike. I hope this long message helps someone else out there who is on the fence about doing or adjusting something. <br><br>Just DO IT. <br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Ken </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/bruce950sm.svg" alt=bruce950sm> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">bruce950sm</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-03-16 06:10:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Glad your happy with the modifications and your "new bike" Ken.<br><br>Everybody says good things about the MH airbox. I've had an MH airbox kit sitting on the shelf since before Xmas and am itching to get it all fitted. I just got my TuneECU software connecting to the bike last weekend and was debating about doing the kit in stages, SAS then O2 sensors and then the fly's and the box ( there are no V-twin dealers or dyno shops anywhere near ). After reading your post though I think I will just do the lot next weekend.

Maybe it was the way out of sync throttle bodies or who knows what. All I know is I road 5 miles and I was in heaven. Eat a good breakfast and go tackle that thing. I am sure that you will be happy. I have read so much on the Tune ECU, I know that there are a lot of maps that will get you very close I am sure. I am a Mac guy so no TuneEcu for me. You don't want the bike to run lean. This forum is full of so many helpful people just read and ask.

I have had bootcamp on my mac in the past. I didn't want to do it for TuneECU and then find a copy of windows 7 or pay for one.
