This rattelling/chain slapping only happens up to 2500-3000 rpm on every gear than beyond that no noise as such at all. It makes ridding through traffic hell and embarasing so have to be on high revs most of the times. also on first gear there is a big play between the wheel and gearbox (as if my chain was very loose)<br><br>im now running our of options that im thinking the chains may have been streched somehow beyond tenssioner limits. the previous owner has done a couple of track days and dropped it once or twice (scaff marks).<br>has anyone come across this issue and a possible solution or am i looking completely at the wrong place.<br>nick</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TLSRuss.svg" alt=TLS_Russ> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">TLS_Russ</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-01-13 17:37:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Cam chain tensioner? or is this what you have already checked?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-01-13 20:15:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ktmguy.svg" alt=ktmguy> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">ktmguy</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-01-14 03:14:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Are you sure its not an ex race bike </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TLSRuss.svg" alt=TLS_Russ> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">TLS_Russ</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-01-14 13:43:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>yes it has been take for track days as the previous owner had invested on after market footrests and after market break lines also stated so by himself. also after the first service i noticed the oil filter slightly screwed (as if it was blocked and pressured applied distorted it) and unfortunately some small shavings.<br> <br>Ok so this is something I need to look up with very few tools I have in my shed.<br>Some questions arise, is this a DIY mechanic job? what special tools will it require? any picks, part number direction at what I'm looking at? and if I'm helpless where can I take it near Berkshire other than a $teaÂ£er for a repair rebuild?<br>Nick</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/SDNerd.svg" alt=SDNerd> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">SDNerd</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-01-14 14:32:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Small amount of metal on the magnets is a very normal KTM thing.

I know I can hear my chain slapping the swingarm while riding at lower rpm... Just a thought.<br>Personally I think you are hearing normal sounds that happen when riding a v-twin at low rpm under load and have a loose chain. It seems you have answered your own question in a few of your posts.<br>Have you ridden any other SDs to see if they are the same? Ive ridden 3 and they all sound like that at low rpm...<br>Dont try to fix something that isnt broken, tighten your chain and make sure rear wheel is straight and give it more rpm when riding. I cruise around 4.5-5k rpm, seems to be the smooth spot it likes.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/SDNerd.svg" alt=SDNerd> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">SDNerd</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-01-15 03:40:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Don't want to be the messenger of bad news... but...<br>It it gets worse when warm and cam chains have been checked it could be bad. Things to check:<br>Pistons loose in bore and rattle, due to giving it heaps with cold engine (before 4 bars temp). The SD has forged pistons and over square bore stroke. On a cold engine it is easy to rattle the piston in the bore hence the warm up procedure of no throttle till 4 bars. This problem destroys both bore and pistons.<br>As suggested above it can also be conrod bearings.<br>Another one is rattle in the clutch basket, easiest of the lot to check. Tilt the bike over and undo the cover, no or hardly any oil leaks out.<br>On the other side check the play of the front chain sprocket on the gearbox output shaft, this can rattle also.<br><br>Most of these issues are due to abuse, I hope I'm wrong in my diagnose as it is possible you got a bike that has been badly trashed. <br>The SD loves a bit of trashing, to get to this point it has to be bad.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/lcjohnny.svg" alt=lcjohnny> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">lcjohnny</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-01-15 06:19:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>When a rod bearing is just starting to go you only really her the knock under load at low/medium revs </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Superdan.svg" alt=Superdan> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Superdan</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-01-15 21:31:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>ok i think i better get a Credit Card and bite the bullet, ether a stealer or if anyone can suggest a garage in Berkshire with good reputation as cramp conditions in my shed are against me for engine removal.<br>i used to ride another vtwin and when they are very loose they tend to knock all the time and worst when they get hot. i think the chain is a plausible suggestion and i do her it slap at low speed, i can tighten it and i have had it tight before but still get knocking, clutch basket has had brand new niddle bearings to no avail, front sprocket not loose. <br>Now this may be a common symptom for a ktm with a bit of abuse (i haven't tried another one to compare against) but i have been under bonnets and around combustion engines long enough to know when something is uncomfortably wrong and it feels wrong enough to have stopped me ridding the bike from causing further damage, and i fully accept that vtwins are very harsh to the internal mechanics (but boy i tell you shit loads of fun), so maybe my OCD is taking over and i need to sort it.<br>no disrespect to other post regarding bike feeling normal but ill either need to have it sorted or get rid of the bike (not ready to spoil my biking fun yet) but since im not bored of the bike I'm gone go ahead and try to have it sorted.<br><br>My question is where can i take it? any one experienced a really good garage with knowledge on LC8 in UK?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/JohnJJr.svg" alt=JohnJJr> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">JohnJJr</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2012-01-18 15:14:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I would check the clutch pack, in particular the clutch pack height&amp;
