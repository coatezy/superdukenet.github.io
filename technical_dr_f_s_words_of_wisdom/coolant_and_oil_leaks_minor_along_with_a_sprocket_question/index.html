It's also quite loud (although that's due to the Yosh system I had in the garage before the bike was even there).<br><br>The two leaks;<br><br>- the first is oil and appears to be the upper banjo for the oil sight tube. I don't live near a KTM dealer so can anyone advise the size of the copper washers so that I can get them from a hardware store and have them on hand prior to doing my oil change (which would've been done this weekend but the local Yammie dealer is, so far, a week late getting me my filter)?<br><br>- the second is coolant and appears to be the hose clamp on the t-stat housing line that runs to the water pump. Is there an easy way to get in there to cut off the crap clamp that's there and install a proper clamp? I'm not looking to remove the oil tank just yet.<br><br>The cush play;<br><br>I was cleaning my chain up today and while spinning the wheel by grabbing the sprocket noted that there's a bit of play between the hub and the sprocket carrier (jerk damper bolts). It's minuscule to the point that it took me a while to figure out what it was but I could hear and feel it. When I found it I found it was only movement enough to just see and only appears to occur at two of the five jerk damper bolts. I took the wheel off and looked at the setup (never having seen one like this before) and all looked good. I cleaned it up and re-installed with no change. Is this normal?<br><br>Cheers and thanks in advance.<br>Des</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/samba.svg" alt=samba> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">samba</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-04-03 22:21:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Crush washer probably won't fix oil leak.

Easy fix being either to replace the part or just the tube - you can lean the bike over enough to do this without loosing any oil.<br><br>Cush drive should be 45nm with loctite - I also put a little grease on the posts to reduce the scuffing/wear; I don't think it says to do this in the manual but seems to help.<br><br>For the coolant leak I would check your radiator cap for any crap (ie casting sand) - as if this clogs the whole system tends to over pressurize which causes small leaks elsewhere in the system. Again, I've had the same tiny leak at the thermostat which turned out to be the casting sand in the radiator cap and small amount in the expansion tank; this is after flushing the system extensively twice before ! This is probably why the water pump seal goes prematurely - so if you haven't changed coolant I would recommend doing this as its cheap to do. Read up on the bleed procedure though, as they don't run well with air in the system.</div></p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/about" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/terms" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
