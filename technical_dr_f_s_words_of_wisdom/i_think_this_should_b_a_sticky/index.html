There already may be a post of this somewhere however i need to say: <br> <br>I have an 07 SD i got with 8 thou miles on it 8 weeks ago. As already mentioned now has MH Box - sas off etc etc with Akra's , it's in the shop w/ the dyno guy . To cut the story short after what my dyno guy felt was a smart resetting of the TPS voltage amts he came up with the 3,000 rpm then settling to idle issue. He was frusted to put it frankly. <br> <br>He having the manual out used the manual recommendation for voltage settings for the TPS. ( i don't have the numerical value in my head - but just to say it's listed in the manual under fueling ) --- PROBLEM: If looking elsewhere in the manual particularly the ELECTRICAL section the TPS recommendation there is different than the recommendation in the fueling section . Makes sense to go to the fueling section to look for TPS settings no ? The problem is the voltage recommendation in fueling is what causes the 3,000 auto revving problem --- Turns out that fueling recommendation is for Carburetors and not Throttle Bodies w/ injectors. <br> <br>So i was lucky i spent all the time looking through old threads to come across a thread here that someone made the correct recommendation to FIX the 3,000 rpm problem ......... <br> <br>Others here have had the same problem and i can imagine others coming along looking to make these same modifications to their bikes are going to face the SAME problem and i could see where it could really RACK someone's brain !! You're making the manual recommended adjustment to TPS and you're all FOOKED up .... <br> <br>Point is - SIMPLY : the Correct voltage recommendations for TPS is actually in the Electrical Section - so if it's not already listed in Sticky might be a good idea for future tuners here to get the info as a heads up . <br> <br>Just sayin. i was really lucky i spent all that time and found that one thread where the correct voltage was mentioned - i almost LOST my dyno guy in MID stream because he was kinda frustrated and the communication was breaking down . he's pretty sharp though and we managed to get it ironed out but only because i managed to keep my cool as well.... AND only because i had found that one thread and was lucky enough to print out the info . Otherwise this could have racked up hours trying to figure out the problem .. <br> <br>Thnx you guys - forum is priceless. <br> <br>keeping in mind that while the bike's getting dyno'd the clock's a tickin - which costs money - My guy showed some characted and didn't charge for that time spent in limbo while figuring out correct voltage values - He basically didn't charge me at all for that .... <br> <br>thnx again <br> <br>johnny <br> <br>ps. Bumped the RPM's 10,100 - the HP curve maintained itself through the previous 9.6 to 10,100 -- No drop off in power - i say COOLEO !!! <br> <br>i'll be back [/u]</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/MrZ32.svg" alt=MrZ32> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">MrZ32</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-09 08:56:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>tps 3.8V cold at full throttle opening (engine off). <br> <br>should make the voltage when hot and running (after 15min throttle reset) at 0% throttle around .63 to .66 (although KTM says .56 - .6V.) <br> <br>this is what i have found the most effective... I have played with a lot of the different sensors... after enough calibration i have the thing running silky smooth. <br> <br>BTW... 3000rpm bit lasts for about 5 to 10 seconds when during tps reset. <br> <br>reason for 3k rpm is the tps talks directly to the idle speed controller. <br> <br>Too lower a voltage will cause the idle speed controller to cut in too much and not get anywhere near 100% throttle opening (more like 92%), <br> <br>too high a voltage will give true 100% throttle opening but Idle speed controller will not kick in and bike will stall almost every time that the throttle is lifted off(or if only a lil off every now and then under heavy braking)</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/JohnJJr.svg" alt=JohnJJr> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">JohnJJr</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-01-09 09:05:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="about.html" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="terms.html" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
