Havent been for a few years now so my info may be a little out of date.<br><br>Twin towers have gone for a start so no trip to the roof. Actually the roof was closed more often than not but you could take the express elevator up to the 40 something floor and look out the window. Be glad you didnt have to jump out of it.<br><br>Trouble with New York is you walk with deja vue as you have seen everything so often on tv.<br><br>Empire State Building isnt that tall. It isnt even as tall as the office blocks surrounding it. Best tip is go up it at night for the city lights. You be Tom Hanks, she be Meg Ryan call it Sleepless in Southend.<br><br>FAO Schwartz by Centre Park is the top shop where they filmed BIG. You be Tom Hanks, she be an inflatable sex doll - you will get thrown out.<br><br>Got into Radio City Music Hall on year for the X Mas show, lucky as a guy was returning tickets for that night as I walked in. Never managed to get in again, those Rockettes would get it. Never bothered with Letterman, dont bother to watch him here either.<br><br>Dont waste you time with Maceys it may be the worlds largest dept store but it is just a lot of ajoining department store badly knocked into one. Think of a tatty Harrods with mismatched floor levels. Bloomingdales for the essential naff paper bag.<br><br>Statue of Liberty is smaller than you would think too. You will see it on the plane landing if you go to JFK. Best tip here is to take the helicopter tour as the ferry / walk up is just a pointless shuffle up a narrow spiral staircase with your head up some other tourist's arse.<br><br>I used to stay in the Renaissance on Times Sq.

You call NY dirty and you live in London?! I can appreciate that after your umpteenth visit you'd be tired of it but way to go to take the sheen off another man's excitement. Ignore it Shade, It's brilliant and I know you share my sense of wonderment and enthusiasm; myself and two other pilots walked around with big grins on our faces and wide excited eyes pointing out bits that we'd seen in movies, sounds we'd heard etc. I fooking loved it, people were friendly and helpful with a great sense of humour and New Yoik was more than I could have hoped for.

The people are funky, the girls are pretty, it's like a movie cliche on every street corner, and it's nice to be somewhere that actually lives up to the hype. (...unlike LA,or London for that matter).<br><br>Have breakfast at the River Cafe "down under the Manhatten Bridge Overpass" (DUMBO for short) if you wanna impress the missus, for amazing food, old school service and greeat views.<br><br>Go shopping in the big department stors, make sure you check China Town, Little Italy, Soho and Nolita. Go to small cafes and weird shops, breakfast is alway,s the best meal of the day. I thought the East Village was less good than the West (less walkable), ...Ground Zero is kind of interesing as is the rest of "downtown". Times Square is a bit shyte to be honest. You can ignore 42nd Street, etc, but Central Park is beautiful for when you head uptwon. The Empire State (midtown, not downtown) is cool but the Chrysler building is cooler, gatecrash a few hotel bars for evening drinks, try to get invited up the roof of Soho House (you'll need to meet a member), use the Subway and cabs, forget buses - or walk when you're between the Village and Soho/Nolita/Chinatown. <br><br>e.g. Hang Out on the corner of 13th &amp; 9th in the meatpacking District then walk through the Village down Bleeker Street into Soho. Then shop, nibble and coffee around Broadway, Mercer, Wooster and Greene Street Between Prince Street and Broome in Soho, before heading over Broadway into Nolita or toward downtown into Chinatown. ...or maybe do that backwarsd and Finish around 13th &amp; Ninth for drinks and food in the early evening. I think there's some kinda biker bar up in the area as loadsa Harleys seemed to cruise in the area. It's also where all the late night bars and clubs are.<br><br>You can also head up Broadway from Union Square, for a bigger city vibe than Soho, etc, and the further up you go, the posher it gets. Broadway is a good street to reference the rest of new york city from, as it cuts diagonally across the huge wide grid from South East to North West, as is W Houston, which divides the large gridded streets of midtown upwards from the more London-like random streets of the Village and Soho below.<br><br>I did one find an amazing antiques market in Midtwon west, which was outdoor and huge, where there was some amazing Asian stuff that you'd never find in Europe. I came back with Chinese swords. LOL.<br><br>Try also drinking at the roof of the Thompson Hotel (Soho, near Prince Street), which they say is a members club, but you can usually blag your way in if you're a Brit. Regarding boat trips, it's a great city to see from the rive, so def incorporate that into your trip.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/OldTLSDoug.svg" alt=OldTLSDoug> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">OldTLSDoug</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-02-21 11:23:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>If you want to shoot, come to Texas sometime, most places will let you have at it.
