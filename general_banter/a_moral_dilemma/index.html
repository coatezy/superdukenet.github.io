Got the twins, (three months old now), got the 20 month old daughter, got the all time consuming job. Got my other two kids as well that I try and see at the weekends. Amy is doing so well managing to cope, sometimes I'm not there enough because of the job. But I try to get home every night in time to cook a meal for everyone and get the kids to sleep. We get about an hour together every night. Quality time? Not sure.... we are so knackered and worn out. Anyone with kids will understand this. Weekends are about a bit of recovery and sharing the load. But OMG I miss the SD time. The Sunday runs, (sorry Kliky), the messing about cleaning and fettling the bike, the needless trips round the bike shops on Saturday morning to look at stuff and just get the bike fired up. <br><br>Just to hear the engine running.<br><br>Just to put on my leathers.<br><br>Just to smell engine oil.<br><br>Just to clip my visor down and snick the gearbox into first.<br><br>Just to find an open road and tear through the quickshifter,<br><br>to hit the apex,<br><br>to get the rush,<br><br>to breath.<br><br>to live.<br><br>Do you understand?<br><br>fook. I managed to get the 13th at Brands Hatch with some of you guys. I was rusty.<br><br>I'm booked onto the 18th for another tiny break of liberation.<br><br>But I just don't know how far I can push it with Amy. I'm genuinely think she will not agree to two/three days on her own coping with three kids without me. And I don't really know if it's fair to ask.<br><br>So come on you lot. Give me a thread that I can let her read. A thread so I don't need to ask her myself. A thread that I can, one night after I cook her a meal and put the kids to bed and clean up the kitchen and give her a bunch of flowers and tell her I love her and then take her to the computer and say,<br><br>"read this"......<br><br>If you guys can't put together a compelling argument why I should leave my beautiful girlfriend, mother of my children, best mate, trusted friend, long suffering partner to spend three days with you ugly lot, crashing bikes, talking shit, drinking cheap beer, farting, unwashed, oily, stinking, sweaty.......<br><br>.....then I don't know who can.<br><br>My fate is in your hands my good friends. </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/shadowman.svg" alt=shadowman> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">shadowman</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-29 21:56:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Hi Bic,<br><br>I might go myself, haven't decided yet but then I don't have to justify the decision to anybody so it's easy.

What exactly might that be here? Not like you're forsaking all for hookers and blow. I say its just guilt talking here. A valueless commodity, guilt. For people who don't ride and/or clearly have time to kill. A clean bike is a sign of wasted time (life) that could have been spent riding!<br><br>If you're worried about "fair" (and there is no "fair") - I'm going to assume she has some time consuming interests she's passionate about, external to home, family, and you - ? Maybe encourage her to do on occasion as you'd like: To get away for a few days now and then, where you'll take on the whole enchilada while she gets away from the "routine". <br><br>It's something anyone with a lot on their plate needs - that occasional escape. Business travel is hardly that, and when you return all expect you to make up for time away - as if you were on holiday or something. <br><br>Finding that balance with the sig other, and encouraging each other to pursue the things that you're both passionate about - independent of each other, is what can make things work IMO. Plenty of other common interest time to fill the days of your lives, to not worry (or feel guilty) about the occasional departure.<br><br>Good luck man!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TwistedJester.svg" alt="Twisted Jester"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Twisted Jester</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-29 23:23:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>It is a difficult one, I'm not sure if I have the answer, I solved it by sending my mrs and the kids to another country to see her Mum </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Superdan.svg" alt=Superdan> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Superdan</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-06-30 00:03:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Id love to be able to write something compelling to aid your worry.<br><br>But from what I have read about you and Amy as your partner, I have no doubt if you mentioned the very thought of this to her she would be asking why you had not booked up already, and I presume her happiness <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> seeing you happy, and I think if she knew spending 3 days with some unruly hooligans would not bring a smile to your face for the next month to come and the month after, then she cant know you very well.
