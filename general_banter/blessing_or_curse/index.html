Understand ? You can't bring your work home . Don't carry it around with you at home. People who are good at sports for example - a good basketball player has to put on a whole different mentality to play baseball just as a person who's good at baseball needs to put on a whole new mentality to play tennis. No different than hopping on a superduke - takes a whole different set of skills but skills we're capable of having. <br><br>before you walk through the front door of your home put on a new set of skills and feelings , emotions , ground yourself and put that shit together man !!! People have enough sense and brain power to figure this stuff out. It's a practice , turns into a skill , one that improves and grows .<br><br>I've been taking Aikido for over 15 years and that realization was one of the biggest take aways for me. When i / we practice Aikido everything else about our life ( our day ) just can't be carried onto the mat while training with our partners . We have to put on a whole new hat/jacket otherwise we're not practicing Aikido . Aikido is about being in the moment and being honest about what's happening in that moment . When it's right we don't carry a preconceived idea of training onto the mat - The best Aikido is just being present / adaptable along with a lot of things that i don't even understand or have discovered yet ( That's my reality ) <br><br>If i were living with someone again before i walk through the door or meet her for dinner somewhere i put on a Relationship mentality not work mentality or Aikido mentality or SD mentality or whatever ( none of that stuff really works in being present with someone ) ---------------<br><br>Maybe i read your post incorrectly and am way out in left field with this response , but anyway - I'm a horseshoer - my fooking hands ache every day - so does my back , horses stink , horses kick and can kill - i put life in the hands of hopefully a higher power every time i shoe a horse as i put myself in the KILL ZONE every time - it's nerve wracking - dangerous - stressful - ( Nails hanging out of horse's hooves that rip through human flesh like hot knife and butter ) - but when i go to aikido i have to put ALL that stuff ( the emotional baggage ) aside in order for my Aikido to be any good at all. Bruce Lee once said " Don't think - FEEL " and " It's about emotional Content " if the contents aren't right shit don't gel !!
