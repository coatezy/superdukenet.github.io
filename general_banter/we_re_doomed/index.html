I've scraped pieces of dead bodies off railroad tracks, almost ran over a corpse on the freeway because it was so disfigured I thought it was a bag of garbage, and saved a few lives as well, but what I saw today finally convinced me that the human race is doomed.<br><br>I saw a young girl, perhaps 12 years old, riding her bike, dangerously close to the double yellow and on the wrong side of the road, while, . . . <br>talking on the fooking cell phone. <br><br>Where would such a young mind get the idea that talking on a cell while riding a bicycle is OK? Probably from her stupid fooking mother that drives her gas guzzling SUV while talking on the phone. <br><br>Every day I see a new PSA about the danger of talking / texting while driving. The latest is a kid that got in an accident and is profoundly retarded because he was in an accident while texting. But, no matter how many PSAs are shown, no matter how many laws are passed, this little girl provided the quintessential proof that you cannot legislate stupidity away. They can pass all the no talking while operating a motor vehicle laws they want, but the stupid fooks will continue to be stupid fooks and they will raise stupid fooking children.

Did not smoke worked out . Another riding his bike and an old lady who was so old she should have been able to drive t-boned him he never had a chance.Minum insurance .Now 2 kids will never see there father again.<br>My one good friend strong as an ox never had any signs just was hard to take a dump.They opened him up stage 4 cancer He worked with me and was going to be hired full time another week he would have insurance. When the company found out the did not put him at full time so now he has nothing and all his co workers had to take a collection just so a pain doctor would see him . Money up front or no doctor. Now they say he is not worth spending the money on since he is gonna die.I can't imanagne the pain he has I had back surgery 3 discs replaced and I thought I was gonna die.<br><br>He is 42 and no one gives a crap because the state is broke giving all the money to people that came hear with nothing and are living off welfare <br>He was born here worked his whole life paid taxes and can't get help. <br>It's not right Ok I get it he is gonna die don't spend a million to try to save him becausw they can't. but can't they make his last days pain free as much as possible? And the company running away when they found out he was sick. <br>It all about the dollar one more week he would have full insurance and been well taken care of now he is at his home waiting to die. They told his girlfriend try to make him comfertable. WTF. She got hired full time and has insurance but if they get married and she ads him she will be stuck with all the bills they say 250grand . She will lose the house they have kids.<br>This make me so sick I just want to puke. Bottom line we are on our own.
