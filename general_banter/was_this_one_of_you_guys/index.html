And who knows if the kid even did anything wrong in the first place and the jerk driver was completely in the wrong for not yielding to someone in a crosswalk? The driver sure wasn't listening to anyone and kept claiming he was the victim of being traumatized by some young kid that was crossing the street. Get a life and move on. The next time a dog runs out in front of you or chases you, should you go find the owner and rant and rant on them and call the cops, get over it. If the bike rider is a member here GOOD FOR YOU for getting involved and defending that young kid, I'll buy you a couple of beers if we ever meet, that Jeep driver was a pompous ASS that was having a bad day and took it out on a young kid. Bet if that was an adult of respectable size he would of kept right on driving and chalked it up to a day in life. He only called the cops because the 990 Super Duke rider stopped to tell him to back off on screaming at the young kid and he was afraid he'd get his ass kicked by the SD rider. LOL. The call to 911 must have been like a kitten up a tree issue to them....911 operator: "Sir let me get this straight, a kid was walking across the street and you had to brake to not hit him and you didn't hit him and then you parked your vehicle on the curb and proceeded to scream at the kid and a biker stopped and told you to stopped doing that to a minor and you got scarred that you were going to get your ass kicked so you called us?" </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/DavoSingapore.svg" alt=Davo-Singapore> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Davo-Singapore</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-10-14 23:50:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Him staying with the bike was a good way to keep some distance, and not making matters worse, while still being there to take some of the heat off the kid.<br>The guys a nut job, but I'm sure glad he didn't hit him with the car.<br>In this age of crazies, the rider had balls - My hats off to him!</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/fatbob.svg" alt=fatbob> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">fatbob</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2015-10-15 00:01:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> </section> </div> </main> </div> </div> <footer class=bg-white> <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl overflow-hidden py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"> <nav class="-mx-5 -my-2 flex flex-wrap justify-center" aria-label=Footer> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="/" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Home</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="about.html" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">About</a> </div> <div class="px-5 py-2"> <a href="terms.html" class="text-base text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900">Terms</a> </div> </nav> <div class="grid place-items-center"> <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coatezy" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" class="mt-10 content-center" style="height:30px !important;width: 108px !important;"> </a> </div> <p class="mt-8 text-center text-base text-gray-400">&copy; 2020 SuperDukeNet.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
