What happens if you are later proved innocent? No shortage of miscarriages of justice on our fair shores. Bit late to apologise later and say sorry about lack of hands or head. I'm all for strong punishments fitting the crime but that is way over the top IMHO. <br> <br>As to peodophilles, I'm probably going to get flamed for this and I'll admit perhaps my views would be completely different if I was a parent. <br> <br>Firstly, I will say, I do agree that serious offenders should be locked up with the key thrown away. <br> <br>My point, that will probably be seen as liberal softy, is that a lot of these people where abused themselves. That does not condone what they are or do for a second but if they can be helped with treatment and are no longer a threat, then letting people know where they live is asking for a lynch mob mentality. No perhaps you wouldn't act on this info but there are plenty of violent people out there who would. This will mean some will move and go underground where they can't be monitored by the authorities or offered continuing treatment and free to perhaps offend again. <br> <br>My other point is that we cannot choose what we are attracted to, only whether we act on it. For most people it's the opp sex of around/above 16 years old and onwards depending on our own age through life. Some the same sex but again within adults of a similar age. For some people though its kids. Now they should know that this is not right, seek help and refrain from acting on these attractions/urges but of course a lot don't and those that do act need to be dealt with by the law. A tiny part of me however (this is the one that will see me lined up and shot) pity's people born this way, as it's not something we can switch on and off. I couldn't decide tomorrow to become gay or be attracted to 18+ stone women as it's not my nature, just as none of you could switch sexuality or what you are attracted to. It's just the way we are wired. What we can do though is choose not to be sexually active and even that's not as easy as it sounds. <br> <br>This is not in my opinion a liberal view but more a realistic view of the situation. They are out there and the ones that offend need locking up and if possible treating. Those that can't be should be kept locked up until such a time that a treatment that be devised. I'm not sure if chemical castration is an option that works. Maybe this would be a better way forward if it does?. <br> <br>Of course if someone I know where to suffer in such a way I'd probably want the perpetrator publicly flogged, castrated and shot. That does not make that the right course of action though.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/SDSmurf.svg" alt=SDSmurf> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">SDSmurf</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2010-02-01 22:25:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Yeah, it's a tough one...

becomes almost unanswerable. It raises such emotion that people’s views become simplistic or idealistic. <br> <br>I do agree there is a case for humane capital punishment of recidivist predatory paedophiles. I would imagine that this is a small number of those convicted. This is the scenario as dramatised in; ‘The execution of Gary Glitter’. A paeodophile who has been convicted, supposedly rehabilitated and then reoffends. It still seems to be a case of shutting the gate after the horse has bolted as at least two children will already have been harmed. At the moment we do not have the death penalty in this country and many that are on her in favour of killing paedos would also oppose a reintroduction of the death penalty so big can of worms there. <br> <br>I think that anything that leads to mob justice and witch hunts would be a scary precedent though. I don’t agree with people being hounded from their homes or worse because they are named, or wrongly identified as a paedo. Mistakes can be made look at Colin Stagg and the Rachael Nickell murder; everyone thought he did it for years. The old bill even tried to frame him for it, yet he wasn’t guilty. How would you feel if you were part of the mob that had lynched or branded or castrated him? <br> <br>How do you define a paedo anyway? We accept Gary Glitter is one, what about Rod Stewart, Jack Nicholson, Peter Stringfellow? All of these shag girls young enough to be their granddaughters. We know Michael Jackson was a nonce* but Adam Ant was shagging Amanda Donahue when she was 15 is he? <br> <br>Actually MJ wasn’t a nonce he was a musical genius. It seems you stop being a nonce if you have enough money to pay off the parents of all the kids you abuse. Then if you are gracious enough to die too = all forgotten, musical genius status resored. <br> <br>As Shade said the Catholic church has condoned and covered up all kinds of child abuse worldwide for centuries. If we are getting out the pitchforks and the flaming torches let us start with and easy identifiable paedo, the local priest. Don’t go past the church hall either, those scoutmasters don’t hang around kids because they like tying reef knots. <br> <br>As Freestyler said it is worryingly easy to be accused of paedophilia these days. My seven year old daughter and her mate run around our garden naked all summer. Should I be hiding in the office waiting for witchfinder Danno and the boys? I hope Freestyler isn’t doing the branding how can I show my face with Puddle Fart branded on it?</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/PigBenis.svg" alt="Pig Benis"> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Pig Benis</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2010-02-02 13:27:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>The truth is we don’t know what are neighbours are into and we are arguably better off not knowing. They may be as pervy as Ducati Pete for all I know but as long as they keep it to themselves …and keep the noise down….. and let me watch …ohher lost my train of thought now. <br> <br>Oh yes, I don’t want paedos living near me. I don’t want any kind of sex offender, convict, pikey, acquisitive criminal, nosey bastard, old people (oxygen thief) or young people (too noisy). In fact I don’t really want anyone living near me, except Kelly Brook, but I don’t get a choice. <br> <br>If we are talking about it I don’t want to pay for rehab or social housing for paedos. But then I don’t want to pay for welfare and social housing for the workshy, feckless, promiscuous single mothers (unless they will let me have a jump too), illegal immigrants, useless social workers and evil little bastards like the Bulger kids being dragged up by scum parents. I don’t want to buy gym memberships and playstations for the obese, Nigerian women to fly here and give birth as a plane ticket is cheaper than medical care in their own country. <br> <br> I don’t want to pay for a NHS system that is abused from within and without. The trouble is I have to. It is called the welfare state and I vote to abolish it. It has strayed so far from the ideals of its founders it is now just a burden on my children far more real and dangerous that the supposed paedo down the road. <br> <br>I don’t want to pay tax that is used to bail out banks that still pay huge bonuses the bankers, or pay MP’s salaries and their inflated expenses claims. I don’t want the Olympics here so that every country but ours can send drug fuelled meat heads to win medals. We cant afford it and I don’t want to pay for it. <br> <br>I don’t want my tax payments to perpetuate unwinnable wars in Afghanistan and Iraq so that more of our young men can get shot there with bullets we paid for. But I have no choice in the matter <br> <br>You guys are right. You do worry a lot more when you are a parent. I worry about all of the above. I worry about the decline in morality in society so that kids like the Bulger case ones can do harm to other kids. I worry about the future tax burdens my children will face for their whole working lives because of the policies of our current government. I cannot imagine losing a child or having a child abused. However, I am not about to lynch the local pervert just in case. As Shade says our children are probably far safer than we were. In the scheme of things the paedo possibility is quite low on my worry list.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img

number of sex offence cases has not increased for decades but due to the increased media coverage the world has now got, the general public now have multiple ways to find out about any of the more serious ones. <br> <br>I know of a 16 year old who got done for a technical rape charge for sleeping with his 15 year old girlfriend, he was also placed on the sex offence register. <br> <br>If somebody did something to my kids I'd want the blood of that individual but I still don't think there should be a blanket free for all for people to go round the country and take out all the people charged with a sex offence by announcing where they all live, it's not exactly going to come with a file with all the facts of each case. <br> <br>Innocent people have already been harmed by that kind of mob mentality taking the law into their own hands. <br> <br>What about those stories you see about kids that make it up, you hear about the ones that are found out to be lying but how many didn't get found out, how could you be 100% certain of the facts before you dole out the punishment. <br> <br>I don't know much about chemical castration but I do remember watching one program with a guy who was a paedo who actually got himself surgically castrated because he said he couldn't control it and apparently it stopped him having those uncontrollable urges. <br> <br>So if it does work then perhaps it should be made mandatory for repeat offenders, it may not help the first two kids but it may stop future and perhaps worse offences before they get "confident" at doing it. <br> <br>It's definitely a minefield of emotions this one and no simple answers</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img
