When its a bit warmer I like to wear my motor cross helmet and goggles.<br> My nose it a little exposed to the elements but usually the sun visor or chin guard catches any projectiles. Not tonight. Quick blat up to around 140kmh down the straight approach road and BAM!!. I cop a moth about half the size of my hand right on the sniffer. Stinging pain and moth goo all over my nose and face. Really hurt but also made me laugh. Reminded me of riding down the freeway one day and the car in front of me flicked up a steel bar that had fallen on the road. Came wizzing straight at my head, lucky I ducked, was quite exciting. <br>Made me wonder what sort of interesting road hazards/projectiles my fellow super dukers have encountered. Don't really want to hear about cars doing dumb things that's kinda a given.

In those days I used to get up quite early to go to work and often Balmain seemed to have pea-soupers because it is on the harbour - the famous one. Anyway there I was at about 4:00am riding the trusty 250cc Yamaha stroker to work through the fog when suddenly a huge tom runs out and under the wheels! Shite, thump, thump, wobble, wobble, wobble and stop. Look back and there is said animal in middle of road with a clearly broken spine and in great pain. Park the bike and walk back thinking "Oh shite what do I do now?". Clearly nobody around and no convenient veterinary hospital. <br>In a moment of panic I decide that the best and most humane course of action is to put the animal out of its misery but how? The only device that becomes apparent is the brick that is keeping the lid on a nearby rubbish bin. Umm don't really want to do this but ... Whack!! The animal continues to twitch. Whack! Whack! Whack! And at that very moment I get silhouetted by car headlights as one comes around the corner. My living memory to this day is the look of horror on the two faces framed by the car windows as they cruised by in the early morning fog and saw a bikie doing what bikies presumably always do - killing cats with a brick just for fun.</div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Dutch.svg" alt=Dutch> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Dutch</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-18 12:34:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ShadeTheChangingMan.svg" alt=ShadeTheChangingMan> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">ShadeTheChangingMan</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-18 12:49:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Two pedestrains (one hospitalised) one cylist (ran over and bent his rear wheel, and stayed upright) and a pigeon (low speed). </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Millar.svg" alt=Millar> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Millar</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-18 13:02:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>Had a bird strike on the lid when out with TJ a coupla years ago, came out of a roadside hedge with no distance between us to react....the first hit TJ's bike (I think) the second hit me on the lid but bounced off.

We both workjed at Steinways and had to commute from Gravesend to WC1 every day. He didnt want to ruin his FZR100 or me mt brand new GSXR750 so we bought a commuter between us. The first was a 500 quid CX500 which we then traded for a CX500 eurosport. Then a cheap finance deal lured us to trade for a Suzuki DR750 BIG, stonking traily single widowmaker..<br><br>Everyweek we would take it in turns to ride up with the other on pillion and half asleep. This week was Dave's turn to ride. Up the A2 filter through Deptford as around by Goldsmith's college. Half of the road here had been made a buslane causing traffic to queue in the remaining half a road. Not us though, Dave would run straight across the bus lane and up on the left hand pavement to get to the front of the queue for the lights.<br><br>On this particular day there is a copper standing on the edge of said kerb looking for cars in the bus lane though </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/Willh.svg" alt=Willh> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Willh</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-18 21:55:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p>Post missing.</p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/ColonelKlinck.svg" alt=Colonel_Klinck> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Colonel_Klinck</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-18 22:50:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I'm going to bend the rules even further. About 20 years ago I was in a car with Dan aka Motoronin. We were driving to Cheltenham in his mum's Golf GTI Cabriolet. I'm skinning up on my lap and we come to a small queue of traffic. There had been some heavy storms earlier and the road is flooded up ahead for about 150m. There are two coppers standing just under knee deep in the water at each end sending cars though two or three at a time in turn. We get to the front and wait for the cars coming from the other end to clear out of our way. Now rather than just driving sensibly through the water at two mph and avoiding the attentions of the two boys in blue, Dan floors it and ploughs through the water at more like 20mph. A tsunami like wall of water 8ft high hits the copper at our end square in the face. I will never forget the look on his face when he saw it coming. He was so in shock he didn't even properly turn away. After we passed he just stood there, his wellies were full to the brim and as it had stopped raining a good hour before, he had also removed his water proof jacket. The guy nearly drowned the wall was that big. <br>To be honest I was also in slight shock. Those of you that know Dan have probably witnessed a act of lunacy at some point and I can assure you he was 10x as bad back then. But to me, with a half rolled biffta in my lap, this seemed to be pushing our luck to the extreme! The copper at the far end frantically waves Dan down. He's also in a slight state of shock but also on the verge of losing it. He demands to know just what the hell did Dan think he was doing? Dan then and with a totally straight face, gives him some story of how the car is likely to stall if driven slowly through the water as the exhaust is underwater. The copper is in a dilemma now. He wants to tear Dan a new one, he knows that is a bullshit answer, he can see me trying not to look guilty in the passenger seat while bent forward trying to conceal the half made biffty in my lap. He looks at his buddy, the line of cars at each end and as it's a busy road decides the traffic situation has to take priority. He tells Dan to slow the fook down next time and sends us on our way. As we exit the water and pass the cars waiting the people in the front car are pissing themselves laughing at what had just happened. Still makes to laugh to this day eveytime I think about it. You fooking loon Dan </div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/990EXODUS.svg" alt=990EXODUS> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">990EXODUS</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2011-10-18 23:27:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>I hit a full grown deer about 15 years ago on my XL250R on Easter Sunday.
