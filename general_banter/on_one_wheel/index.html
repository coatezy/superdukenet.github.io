It was a beautiful late afternoon in California. I was just to the tree when I happened to catch out the corner of my eye a kid on a stingray wheeliing past. He was already up on one wheel as he rode by. I stopped to watch to see how long it would last and he rode down the street and dropped the front when he cought up to his buddy. I picked my oranges and ate them and was walking back around the other side of the house when I saw the kid again, heading back home. I called him over and said that he has pretty good balance and perhaps he should try a unicycle. He said " UH I dont know". I told him that I had bought a unicycle and had tried to ride it but it was not going to happen. I do not have the talent, patience, or fearlessness required to pull it off. I told him that the last time I had tried, I nearly cracked my head open on the pavement and that I would like to give him the unicycle but I would like to condition it on him wearing a helmet while he learns. He was utterly dumbfounded that this old man (53), would just give him a unicycle. I told him that he had a tallent and because he showed such talent that he deserved the rewarding of his talent to an even higher level. The reason I bought the unicycle in the first place is I was going to end up with wheelies on the SD that would last for miles. I can wheelie, and some of them impress even me, but they are always performed on the power, never at the magic balance point. I saw a racer in the pits tooling around on a unicycle and he also performs some spectacular shows out on the track. His name is Danny Eslick, and he rides in the AMA Daytona Sportbike series. In fact he won the championship last year. That was my inspiration, though it never reached fruition. The kids name is Ty and he was totally egstatic over his new toy. I only hope he continues to put his talent toward such shananigans. Heck maybe I will sponsor him in a roadrace series. Back to Danny Eslick, type in backing it in and Danny Eslick in a google search, the guy is just spectacular to watch. Super-Moto is quite the show. We are younger longer as I just cannot imagine the thought of Dad even thinking of a unicycle, ever. <br><a class=postlink href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I9uRwBEHSc&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I9uRwBE ... re=related</a></div></p> </div> <div class="pb-8 mb-8 border-b-4"> <div class="sm:flex sm:space-x-5 mb-4"> <div class=flex-shrink-0> <img class="mx-auto h-14 w-14 rounded-full" src="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/bottts/TheJoker.svg" alt=TheJoker> </div> <div class="mt-4 text-center sm:mt-0 sm:pt-1 sm:text-left"> <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">TheJoker</p> <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-600">2010-04-25 12:12:00 UTC</p> </div> </div> <p><div class=content>That's a very cool gesture of you.
