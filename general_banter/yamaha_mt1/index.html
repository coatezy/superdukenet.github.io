The gap was huge. It actually got ridiculous and really irritated me.<br>I couldn't get cruise control to work. It could have been me who had no clue how to use it but in my mind it was the usability (or perhaps broken already) and I went away thinking it was shit.<br>I felt I was always doing 10-20 miles above what the speedometer read. I guess that's a good thing on the road.<br>It didn't tip in quickly. it was by no means sluggish but the initial turn in required effort, and slow riding around town the steering was way too tight. I prefer the loose agile set up of the ktm a lot more.<br><br>I have been slightly swayed by the looks over time but it's definitely not in the top 10 best looking bikes at the moment.

I'm a doer, not a daydreamer. I make things happen. <br><br>But I never seem to get the job here done. I don't know why but I suspect it's because of one of three reasons:-<br><br>1. My heart isn't in it. Despite wanting to try new bikes I'm happy and satisfied with my Superduke and the old Kawasaki triple.<br><br>2. I'm subconsciously worried that I will find a bike way better than than the 990 that I financially cannot afford to implement.<br><br>3. The dealerships, manufacturers, sales teams don't make it easy. Somehow there are always things that get in the way of just jumping on a bike and having a go. <br><br>If I was trying to sell me a new bike I can think of a dozen ways that I could make it easier or more seductive to turn away from my 990 or H2 but so far none of them have come close. <br><br>In the old days (back in the late '70s and '80s for me) everyone had the same Norwich Union insurance cover which were called "rider policies". What this meant was that you were insured to ride any bike up to the cc limit of your policy. So basically you could legally ride any of your mates bikes and they were covered if you smashed it up. So bike meets and every night down the pub you went out and had a go on your mates bike. When the new Yamaha LCs appeared everyone had a go on one. I mean everyone! The old school KH250 riders just had to admit they were utterly outgunned and the Suzuki X7 was officially an also ran. It was a democratic process based on personal experience. It was easy to have a go on a Honda CBX or a Dunstall Suzuki or even having a laugh on a Honda Superdream.
